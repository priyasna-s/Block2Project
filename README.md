What does the program do? 
This is a simple password strength checker. In this program, you enter a password repeatedly until you type a password that is considered strong. The program provides a list of ways to strengthen your password and verify these requirements each time a new password is entered. 6 requirements need to be met. The password must have a lowercase and an uppercase letter, have a number, have a special character that does not include space, and must be at least 13 characters long. After entering each password, the program prints out all the different criteria that were not met, and this process repeats until the user enters a “strong” password. The program ends, and the user is then prompted with a screen saying that the user has a strong password.  

You do not need any dependencies for this program.

Ethical Considerations?
When writing a program, there are many ethical things to consider. For example, we can examine how the program can be used responsibly as well as how it can be misused. This program takes in user input and determines if the user input that was given would be a strong password or not. The program considers 6 different criteria that need to be met for a password to be considered strong. This program can be used responsibly by individuals to check if their password would be considered “strong” and can help people generate and create passwords that would make their accounts more secure. However, this can also lead to people developing a false sense of security with the program. While it is effective in checking the given password, this program can be misused by having it maliciously modified so that the passwords that the user enters are saved somewhere else, leading people to have their passwords for sensitive information stolen or sold to other people on the internet. The strength checker creates a false sense of security that can make it an easy target for misuse, since if people trust the program enough, they can use it as a tool to check passwords for all the websites that they choose to go to.
